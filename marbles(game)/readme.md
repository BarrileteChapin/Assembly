# Description: 
“Marbles game” designing by using MIPS.


It has only three rounds. Each of you has 10 marbles. In each round, you have to enter a bet number and guess your enemy’s bets (even or odd). Once you have correct 
guessing, your enemy needs to give you his marbles (according to your bets). On the  other side, you have to give yours (according to his bets) if you have incorrect guessing. 
The game will stop when one of you has no marbles or three rounds later. Whoever has the most marbles is the winner.
